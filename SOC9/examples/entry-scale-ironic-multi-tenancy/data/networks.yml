  networks:
    #
    # This example uses the following networks
    #
    # Network       CIDR             VLAN
    # -------       ----             ----
    # External API  10.0.1.0/24      101 (tagged)
    # Management    192.168.110.0/24  100 (untagged)
    # Provisioning  (see note 1)     102 (untagged)
    # Tenant VLANs  (see note 2)     1000-1100 (untagged)
    #
    # Notes:
    # 1. Provisioning VLAN should be configured as tagged (trunked) on the
    # switch port for control plane, and ironic compute. For ironic baremetal
    # nodes, switch configuration should allow assignment (real assignment will
    # be performed by neutron driver). Provisioning network is configured as
    # neutron provider network in data/neutron/neutron_config.yml.
    #
    # 2. Similar to provisioning network, tenant VLAN ID range should be tagged
    # (trunked) on the switch for control plane nodes and allow such
    # configuration for ironic baremetal nodes. On Ardana side, it is configured
    # untagged (see example below). Switch configuration for ironic baremetal
    # nodes will be set by neutron driver. VLAN ID range to be used by neutron
    # driver needs to be set into tenant-vlan-id-range field for TENANT-VLAN
    # network group in network_groups.yml.
    #
    # Modify these values to match your environment
