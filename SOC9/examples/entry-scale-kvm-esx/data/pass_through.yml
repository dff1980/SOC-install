    # The below 'servers' section is used to define variables for
    # the various esx-compute-proxy and esx-ovsvapp appliances.
    #
    # The 'id' refers to the name of the node (ESX hypervisor) running the
    # esx-compute-proxy. This is identical to the 'servers.id' in
    # servers.yml. There should be one esx-compute-proxy node per ESX
    # resource pool or cluster.
    #
    # cluster_dvs_mapping should be of the format:
    # 'Datacenter-name/host/Cluster-Name:Trunk-DVS-Name',
    # where 'host' is the actual string 'host' and should not be changed or
    # substituted.
    #
    # vcenter_id is the same as the 'vcenter-uuid' obtained in the global
    # section.
    #
    # 'id': is the name of the appliance manually installed, 'ovsvapp1' for
    # example.
    #
    # 'vcenter_cluster': Name of the vcenter target cluster
    #
    # esx_hostname: hostname of the esx hypervisor hosting the ovsvapp
    # appliance
    #
    # NOTE: For every esx host in a cluster there should be an ovsvapp
    # instance running.

    # Once the esx-compute-proxy and  esx-ovsvapp appliances
    # have been deployed, and the appropriate DVS and DVPGS
    # have been created, add the information for exs-compute-proxy
    # and esx-ovsvapp below.  There should be one ovsvapp per
    # ESX hypervisor, and one esx-compute-proxy per Vmware cluster
