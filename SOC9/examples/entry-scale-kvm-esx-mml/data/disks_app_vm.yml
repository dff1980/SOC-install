  disk-models:
  - name: APP-VM-DISKS
    # Disk model to be used for application vms such as nova-proxy and ovsvapp
    # /dev/sda1 is used as a volume group for /, /var/log and /var/crash
    # Additional disks can be added to either volume group
    #
    # NOTE: This is just an example file and has to filled in by the user
    # based on the lvm partition map for their virtual appliance
    # While installing the operating system opt for the LVM partition and
    # create three partitions as shown below
    # Here is an example partition map
    # In this example we have three logical partitions
    # root partition (75%)
    # swap (5%) and
    # LV_CRASH (20%)
    # Run this command 'sudo pvdisplay' on the virtual appliance to see the
    # output as shown below
    #
    # — Physical volume —
    # PV Name /dev/sda1
    # VG Name system
    # PV Size 80.00 GiB / not usable 3.00 MiB
    # Allocatable yes
    # PE Size 4.00 MiB
    # Total PE 20479
    # Free PE 511
    # Allocated PE 19968
    # PV UUID 7Xn7sm-FdB4-REev-63Z3-uNdM-TF3H-S3ZrIZ
    #
    # Next run the following command on the virtual appliance
    #
    # sudo fdisk -l
    # The output will be as shown below
    #
    # Disk /dev/sda: 80 GiB, 85899345920 bytes, 167772160 sectors

    # NOTE: Even though we have configured the SWAP partition, it is
    # not required to be configured in here. Just configure the root
    # and the LV_CRASH partition
    # /dev/sda_root is used as a Volume Group for /, /var/log, and /var/crash
    # sda_root is a templated value to align with whatever partition is really used
    # This value is checked in os config and replaced by the partition actually used
    # on sda e.g. sda1 or sda5
